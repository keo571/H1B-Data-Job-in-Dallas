## Dataset

The dataset comes from [H1B Salary Database](https://h1bdata.info/index.php).

The H-1B visa is a work permit that allows foreign workers to go to the United States and work for American companies. The data on which companies have submitted petitions, what base salaries they are proposing to pay such workers, and where the workers will work is publicly available. While it applies to foreign workers only, it can still be used to get an idea of what kinds of jobs are available across various job categories and identify some possible trends.
